# My Plugin [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/realbig/ci-sandbox.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/realbig/ci-sandbox)

## INSTRUCTIONS

After cloning this repo, there's some refactoring to be done:

- My Plugin
- MyPlugin
- MYPLUGIN
- my-plugin.php (make sure to also edit reference in `tests/bootstrap.php`
- my-plugin-functions.php

It is then recommended to get the latest version of phpunit.phar to add to the repo for function reference.

Then you need to configure your external libraries for WordPress and the WordPress WP_UnitTestCase;
